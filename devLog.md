## info

- another article: https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/08/23/your-first-ocr-project-with-tesseract-and-python/

## To improve / future work
- in `delete_duplicate.py`, the function `is_the_same` is built. You can build another one, is_similar, calculate the error between two matrices, return true of error is smaller than the threshold. 


## 自己挖的坑
- in the folder `data/img/`, images should be named like "frame_1.jpg", "frame_100.jpg"
